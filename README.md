## Problem Statement

Virtual meetings have become a ubiquitous tool for professional and personal communication. However, the absence of physical cues poses a significant challenge in assessing participant engagement and emotional feedback. This project addresses the following challenges:
- Automatically detecting and classifying facial expressions from video streams.
- Generating quantitative insights into participant emotions throughout the duration of a meeting.

## Dataset

- **Dataset**: [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
  - **Source**: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge, ICML 2013 Workshop.
  - **Description**:
    - Comprises 36,887 grayscale images with a resolution of 48x48 pixels.
    - Each image is labeled with one of seven basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, or neutrality.
    - **Training Data**: 28,709 images.
    - **Validation Data**: 3,589 images.
    - **Testing Data**: 3,589 images.

> You can download the dataset from [Kaggle's FER-2013 Dataset Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).

## Proposed Solution

### **Methodology**
1. **Face Detection**:
   - Implemented using the Haar-Cascade Classifier in OpenCV, which identifies faces in real time by analyzing grayscale pixel values.
2. **Emotion Recognition**:
   - Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Xception architecture, trained on the FER-2013 dataset.
3. **Analytics**:
   - Generates comprehensive reports summarizing the distribution of emotions over the course of a meeting.

### **System Workflow**
1. Preprocessing:
   - Converts video frames to grayscale.
   - Applies Haar-Cascade for face detection and data augmentation for robust model training.
2. Model Training:
   - Trains the Xception model to classify facial expressions with high accuracy.
3. Real-Time Analysis:
   - Processes live video streams to detect emotions and compiles analytics reports.
